Welcome to The Agency. This is your first mission as a shapeshifter agent so I'll be clear about this: you are not going to recover your original face while you’re working here for us. This should not be new to you, though, so I will go right to the point.

Your first mission consists in impersonating Wilson Smith's wife. He is a well known capo and all our intel points out that he is planning something big only his wife knows. 
[next]
Unfortunately, she has just had an accident. Poor, poor Wilson Smith, don’t you think? We cannot let Mr. Smith be sad. This is why we are sending you as his wife so that all those little secrets won’t be secrets anymore. What beautiful love is, isn’t it?
[next]
Now go and prepare yourself. Here you have the intel about your new you. Read it carefully and change your face according the intel. Do not forget to read about your target. A new body can give you all the trust you need easily but you also need to know how the person you are impersonating behaves.
[next]
Do not fail. 
[next]
Be perfect.

You know, just be like me.

Welcome to The Agency. Your predecessor was a total failure and was shot dead. Well deserved in my opinion. I think she acquired her title with the cornflakes or something. Nevertheless, you’re no longer a novice and you’ve become a really good asset so I know you will succeed where she failed.

Do not dare to prove me wrong.
