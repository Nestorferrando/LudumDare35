You will impersonate a luxury prostitute called Jenny Star. Man, he loves her blindly, you've got an easy infiltration here. The only drawback is that we do not know the appearance of this woman, she is very careful hidding her identity. But worry no more! We have a drawing of her.

Good luck out there.
